In this assignment, I use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that 
populates with gifs of your choice. 
To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery 
to change the HTML of your site.

Like many APIs, GIPHY requires developers to use a key to access their API data. 
Obtained an API Key by creating an app.
Make sure you switch the protocol in the query URL from http to https,
or the app may not work properly when deployed to Github Pages.

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, 
non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. 
If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Display its rating (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

a form that takes a value from a user input box and adds 
it to the topics array. Then a function call takes each topic 
in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
